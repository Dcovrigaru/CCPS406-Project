    "intro": "During a long road trip to visit your parents all the way in Manitoba, your car suddenly broke down in a remote area, with no cellphone service nor anyone nearby.\nYou venture into a nearby forest searching for help. There you discover a spooky mansion & decide to enter in desperation, only to be immediately surrounded by zombies.\nIn a state of panic you run into the attic for safety.\nNow, after catching your breath & realizing the horrific situation you've found yourself in, you must navigate through the rooms,\ndefeat the zombies & find your way out!",
    "gameEnd": "The latch works, & the door unlocks. You shove the door open & run out the house, using your flashlight to navigate through the midnight darkness of the woods. Sprinting back to your broken-down car by the highway,\n relief washes over you as you find police investigating the scene. You've been awake, alert & tired for so long & are too exhausted to explain the truth of what you experienced.\nThe police assist with your car & ensure your safety, casually dismissing your condition after they found amounts of strong psychedelics in your car.\nThey don't bother conversating with you much, to which you don't mind. The next morning, clean & composed, you resume your drive to your parents' house, attempting to leave the nightmarish ordeal behind.\nHowever, the trauma lingers, etching a lasting mark on your psyche.\n\n*********THE END**********"
